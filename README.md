# Source Company Site
Class 8-10 homework assignment for a company named Source. I'm unsure if it's a real company or not, but we were given a wireframe for this website to get as close as we could with it.

## Things learned
- Managing different displays based on media queries. This is apparent in the header, where the content changes places and appears/disappears based on the different media queries.
- Using and resizing font awesome icons
- CSS Flexbox
- Using the Digital Color Meter tool on Mac to get the proper color palletes from the project's wireframe
